* Description
This program is inspired by the [[https://st.suckless.org/patches/right_click_to_plumb/][right click to plumb]] patch for the
[[https://st.suckless.org/][Simple Terminal]].

I started using the patch with [[https://surf.suckless.org/][surf]] (lighweight suckless browser) as my plumb
command, but after looking at the [[https://9p.io/wiki/plan9/using_plumbing/index.html][Plan9 plumbing page]], I decided to make my own
personal version.

#+end_src
