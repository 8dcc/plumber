#+STARTUP: showeverything

*Run different commands depending on the text format.*

This program is inspired by the [[https://st.suckless.org/patches/right_click_to_plumb/][right click to plumb]] patch for the [[https://st.suckless.org/][Simple
Terminal]], and was originally designed to be used with [[https://github.com/8dcc/linux-dotfiles][my build of ST]].

I started using the patch with [[https://surf.suckless.org/][surf]] (lighweight suckless browser) as my plumb
command, but after looking at the [[https://9p.io/wiki/plan9/using_plumbing/index.html][Plan9 plumbing page]], I decided to make my own
personal version.

* Building

To build the program, simply run =make=.

#+begin_src console
$ git clone https://github.com/8dcc/plumber

$ make
...
#+end_src

You can also install it with the =install= target.

#+begin_src console
$ sudo make install
...
#+end_src

Note that the commands on the right are the default ones but can be changed from
[[https://github.com/8dcc/plumber/blob/main/src/config.h][src/config.h]].
